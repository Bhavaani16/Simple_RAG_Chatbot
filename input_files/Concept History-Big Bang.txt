EtymologyEnglish astronomer Fred Hoyle is credited with coining the term “Big Bang” during a BBC Radio broadcast in March 1949. He described competing cosmological theories by saying: “These theories were based on the hypothesis that all the matter in the universe was created in one big bang at a particular time in the remote past.” The term did not become widely used until the 1970s.It is often reported that Hoyle, who supported the alternative steady-state model, intended the phrase “Big Bang” to be derogatory. However, Hoyle later denied this and said it was simply a vivid analogy meant to highlight the differences between cosmological models. Some scientific historians argue that evidence supporting the claim of a pejorative intent is weak, and several indicators suggest the term was not meant as an insult.A primordial singularity is sometimes called “the Big Bang,” but the term can also refer more broadly to the early hot, dense phase of the universe. The name has sometimes been criticized as a misnomer because it suggests an explosion into preexisting space, whereas the actual Big Bang describes the expansion of space itself. Others note that the term “bang” implies sound, which is not relevant in this context. Efforts to replace the phrase with a more accurate alternative were unsuccessful, and the term has remained in general use.Science writer Timothy Ferris noted that the term’s longevity reflects Hoyle’s creativity. Ferris also described a global competition in which more than 13,000 entries were submitted to replace the phrase, but none was judged suitable. Thus, “Big Bang” remains the standard term.Before the NameEarly cosmological models developed from observations of the universe’s structure and theoretical work. In 1912, Vesto Slipher measured the first Doppler shift of a “spiral nebula,” discovering that many such nebulae were receding from Earth. At the time, it was debated whether these nebulae were distant galaxies or objects within the Milky Way.In the early 1920s, Russian physicist and mathematician Alexander Friedmann derived equations from Einstein’s general relativity showing that the universe could be expanding, contrary to Einstein’s then-preferred static universe. In 1924, Edwin Hubble measured the distances to nearby spiral nebulae and showed that they were separate galaxies. Using increasingly refined distance indicators, Hubble then established a relationship between galaxy distance and recessional velocity, now known as Hubble’s law, in 1929.Independently, in 1927, Belgian physicist and priest Georges Lemaître derived the same expansion equations and proposed that the recession of galaxies was due to the expansion of the universe. In 1931, Lemaître suggested that the universe had once been concentrated in a “primeval atom,” marking one of the earliest modern formulations of the Big Bang idea.In the 1920s and 1930s, however, most cosmologists preferred an eternal steady-state universe. Some objected that a beginning of time implied religious overtones, especially because Lemaître was a priest. Arthur Eddington also rejected the idea of a beginning, arguing instead for an eternal universe. Lemaître responded that concepts such as space and time themselves would be undefined at the earliest moments of the universe.During the 1930s, alternative cosmologies were proposed to explain Hubble’s observations, including the Milne model, oscillatory universe models, and Fritz Zwicky’s tired-light hypothesis.After World War II, two main cosmological theories emerged. Fred Hoyle’s steady-state model proposed continuous creation of matter, maintaining a universe that was roughly the same at all times. The competing expanding-universe model originating with Lemaître was supported by physicist George Gamow, who used it to explain the abundance of chemical elements. Gamow’s colleagues Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman predicted the cosmic microwave background radiation.As a Named ModelIronically, it was Hoyle who coined the term that became permanently associated with Lemaître’s theory, referring to it as “this big bang idea” in a 1949 BBC broadcast. For some time, both theories had supporters, but gradually observational evidence—particularly radio source counts—favored the Big Bang over the steady-state model. The discovery and confirmation of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964 solidified the Big Bang as the leading cosmological model.In 1968 and 1970, Roger Penrose, Stephen Hawking, and George Ellis published theoretical work showing that singularities are an inevitable feature of relativistic Big Bang models. From the 1970s through the 1990s, researchers focused on resolving outstanding issues and refining cosmological parameters. In 1981, Alan Guth proposed cosmic inflation, a rapid early expansion that resolved several major theoretical problems in Big Bang cosmology.Throughout the late 20th century, cosmologists debated the precise values of the Hubble constant and the matter density of the universe. Major progress came with improved telescopes and satellite data, including the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), the Hubble Space Telescope, and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). By the late 1990s, cosmologists had precise measurements of key Big Bang parameters and discovered that the expansion of the universe is accelerating.
