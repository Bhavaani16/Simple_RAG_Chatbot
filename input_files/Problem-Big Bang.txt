Problems and Related Issues in Big Bang PhysicsAlthough the Big Bang model explains many features of the universe, several puzzles and unresolved issues remain. Some have plausible solutions, while others continue to be major research topics in cosmology and particle physics. Many proposed solutions, such as cosmic inflation, help address certain problems but introduce new questions of their own.Baryon AsymmetryOne unresolved issue is why the universe contains far more matter than antimatter. In the early universe, matter and antimatter were produced in nearly equal amounts, with only a tiny excess of matter. When matter and antimatter annihilated, this slight imbalance left behind the matter that now forms stars, galaxies, and planets. The process believed to generate this imbalance is called baryogenesis, which requires three conditions: violation of baryon number, violation of C and CP symmetry, and departure from thermal equilibrium. While these conditions exist in the Standard Model, they are too weak to explain the observed asymmetry, so additional physics may be required.Dark EnergyObservations of Type Ia supernovae show that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. To explain this, cosmologists propose the existence of dark energy, a component of the universe with negative pressure that drives accelerated expansion. CMB measurements indicate that the universe is nearly flat, meaning its total energy density must be close to a specific critical value. However, visible matter and dark matter account for only about 30% of this density, leaving the remaining 70% attributed to dark energy. The nature of dark energy is still unknown; it could be a cosmological constant or a more exotic field such as quintessence. A major unresolved issue is the cosmological constant problem—the large discrepancy between theoretical and observed values of vacuum energy.Dark MatterGalactic rotation curves, gravitational lensing, galaxy cluster dynamics, and CMB anisotropies all indicate that most matter in the universe is not visible. This non-luminous material, called dark matter, does not interact with light but exerts gravitational influence. It makes up about 23% of the total mass-energy of the universe. Despite strong indirect evidence, dark matter particles have not yet been detected directly. Models involving cold dark matter match observations well, though they face challenges such as the “cuspy halo problem” and the “dwarf galaxy problem.” Alternative theories modify gravity instead of invoking dark matter, but none currently match observations as successfully.Horizon ProblemThe cosmic microwave background is extremely uniform in temperature across the sky. However, in a universe with finite age, distant regions should not have been in causal contact—they could not have exchanged information or energy. This is the horizon problem. Cosmic inflation offers a solution: an early period of rapid expansion allows distant regions of today’s universe to originate from a much smaller region that was once in thermal equilibrium. Quantum fluctuations during inflation were stretched to cosmic scales, ultimately seeding the formation of large-scale structure.Magnetic Monopole ProblemGrand unified theories predict the production of magnetic monopoles in the early universe. These hypothetical particles would be extremely massive and should exist in large numbers, yet none have been observed. Inflation solves this problem by expanding space so dramatically that any primordial monopoles would be diluted to undetectable levels.Flatness ProblemThe geometry of the universe depends on whether its density is less than, equal to, or greater than the critical density. Observations indicate that the universe is extremely close to flat. However, in standard cosmology without inflation, any small deviation from flatness would have grown over time, meaning the early universe would have needed finely tuned initial conditions. Inflation again provides a solution: the rapid expansion drives the universe toward flatness, much like how a balloon’s surface becomes flatter as it inflates.Overall PictureThese open questions—baryon asymmetry, dark matter, dark energy, the horizon and flatness problems, and the predicted existence of monopoles—reflect areas where the Big Bang model interacts with high-energy physics. Proposed solutions, especially cosmic inflation, help resolve several issues but bring new theoretical challenges. Understanding these problems remains central to modern cosmology.
