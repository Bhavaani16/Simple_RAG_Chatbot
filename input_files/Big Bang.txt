The Big Bang is a physical theory that describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of extremely high density and temperature. Cosmological models based on the Big Bang concept explain a wide range of phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe.The Big Bang model also addresses the uniformity of the universe through a concept known as cosmic inflation, which describes a period of extremely rapid expansion in the universe’s earliest moments. According to current measurements of the expansion rate of the universe, the Big Bang occurred approximately 13.787 billion years ago, marking the estimated age of the universe. A wide range of independent empirical evidence strongly supports the Big Bang theory, which is now widely accepted in cosmology.By extrapolating the universe’s expansion backward in time, the model describes an extraordinarily hot and dense primordial state. Modern physics, however, does not yet have a complete and widely accepted theory describing the earliest moments of the Big Bang. As the universe expanded, it cooled enough for subatomic particles to form, and eventually atoms. These early atoms—primarily hydrogen, along with helium and trace amounts of lithium—gravitationally collapsed, helped by dark matter, eventually forming the first stars and galaxies.Observations of distant supernovae reveal that the universe’s expansion is accelerating. This discovery led to the concept of dark energy, an unknown form of energy that permeates space and drives accelerated expansion.The concept of an expanding universe was first introduced mathematically in 1922 by physicist Alexander Friedmann, who derived what are now called the Friedmann equations. The earliest observational evidence for expansion came in 1929, when Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies are receding from Earth at speeds proportional to their distance, now known as Hubble’s law.Independently of Friedmann and of Hubble’s early observations, physicist Georges Lemaître proposed in 1931 that the universe originated from a “primeval atom,” introducing the foundational idea behind the modern Big Bang theory. A major breakthrough occurred in 1964 with the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation. Over the following years, measurements revealed that the CMB is remarkably uniform across the sky, and that its energy distribution matches what would be expected from an early hot and dense universe. By the late 1960s, accumulating evidence led most cosmologists to reject the steady-state model in favor of the Big Bang.Despite its successes, the Big Bang model still faces unresolved questions. These include the matter–antimatter asymmetry known as baryon asymmetry, the detailed nature of dark matter, and the origin of dark energy. Current and future observations continue to refine the theory and improve our understanding of the universe’s earliest moments and overall evolution.---Source: Adapted from the Wikipedia article "Big Bang" under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License (CC BY-SA 4.0).
