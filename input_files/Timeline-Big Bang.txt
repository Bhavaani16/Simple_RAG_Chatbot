TimelineAccording to the Big Bang models, the universe at the beginning was extremely hot and compact, and since that time it has been expanding and cooling.SingularityExisting theories of physics cannot fully describe the moment of the Big Bang. Extrapolating the universe’s expansion backward in time using classical general relativity results in a gravitational singularity with infinite density and temperature at a finite time in the past. However, classical relativity is expected to be incomplete under such extreme conditions, and therefore the meaning of this singularity in the Big Bang context is unclear.The earliest time at which general relativity can be reliably applied is called the Planck time. Before this, during the Planck epoch, when the temperature of the universe approached the Planck scale (around 10³² K), quantum gravity effects are expected to dominate. As of today there is no fully accepted theory of quantum gravity. At energy levels above the Planck scale, unknown physics may have influenced the early expansion of the universe.Inflation and BaryogenesisThe earliest phases of the Big Bang are highly speculative because of the lack of direct observational data. In standard cosmological models, the early universe was filled homogeneously and isotropically with extremely high energy density, temperature, and pressure, and it expanded and cooled rapidly.During the first 10⁻⁴³ seconds, known as the Planck epoch, the four fundamental forces—electromagnetic, strong nuclear, weak nuclear, and gravitational forces—were unified. At this stage, the characteristic size of the universe was the Planck length, and temperatures were unimaginably high. The concept of a particle breaks down under these conditions, and a complete description awaits a theory of quantum gravity. As the temperature dropped, gravitation separated from the other forces, beginning the grand unification epoch.Around 10⁻³⁷ seconds, a phase transition triggered cosmic inflation, an exponential expansion of space in which the universe grew enormously in size. Temperatures fell dramatically during this expansion. Inflation helps explain the flatness of the universe and the fact that the observed density is extremely close to the critical value needed for a flat geometry. Quantum fluctuations during this period were stretched to macroscopic scales, seeding the large-scale structure observed in the universe today. Around 10⁻³⁶ seconds, the strong nuclear force separated from the electroweak force, leaving the electromagnetic and weak forces unified.All of the mass-energy contained in the visible universe today originated in a minuscule region before inflation and expanded to a macroscopic scale by the end of the inflationary period. After inflation ended, reheating occurred when the inflaton field decayed, restoring high temperatures and producing a quark–gluon plasma and other elementary particles. Particle motions were highly energetic, with frequent creation and annihilation of particle–antiparticle pairs.At some point, a process known as baryogenesis created a tiny excess of matter over antimatter—roughly one extra particle per tens of millions of particle–antiparticle pairs. This asymmetry is responsible for the existence of matter in the present universe.CoolingAs the universe continued expanding, its density and temperature decreased. Symmetry-breaking transitions placed the fundamental forces and particle properties into their current forms. The electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces separated at about 10⁻¹² seconds.By about 10⁻¹¹ seconds, particle energies became low enough that they are reproducible in particle accelerators. Around 10⁻⁶ seconds, quarks combined to form protons and neutrons. The slight excess of quarks over antiquarks resulted in a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. As temperatures dropped, creation of new proton–antiproton and neutron–antineutron pairs ceased, and annihilation eliminated most of the remaining antiparticles. A similar event occurred for electrons and positrons around one second.A few minutes into the expansion, at temperatures of roughly a billion kelvin, protons and neutrons combined to form deuterium and helium nuclei, a process known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Most protons remained as hydrogen nuclei.As cooling continued, the energy density of matter exceeded that of radiation at about 50,000 years. Around 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe cooled enough for electrons and nuclei to combine into neutral atoms during an event known as recombination. This made the universe transparent; the photons released at that time persist today as the cosmic microwave background.Structure FormationAfter recombination, denser regions of matter gravitationally attracted more mass, eventually forming gas clouds, stars, galaxies, and other large-scale structures. The details depend on the types and amounts of matter present. Matter in the universe is categorized as cold dark matter (CDM), warm dark matter, hot dark matter, and baryonic matter. Observations, especially from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), show that the Lambda-CDM model fits the data well. In this model, cold dark matter accounts for about 23 percent of the mass-energy content of the universe, while baryonic matter accounts for roughly 4.6 percent.Cosmic AccelerationMultiple lines of evidence, including observations of Type Ia supernovae and the cosmic microwave background, show that the universe is now dominated by dark energy, a mysterious form of energy that permeates all of space. It constitutes roughly 73 percent of the universe’s energy density. In the early universe, gravity dominated because matter density was much higher. Over billions of years of expansion, the decreasing density of matter relative to dark energy allowed the expansion of the universe to begin accelerating.In its simplest form, dark energy is modeled by a cosmological constant in Einstein’s field equations. However, its true nature is unknown, and the details of its behavior and relationship to the Standard Model of particle physics remain active areas of research.All cosmic evolution after inflation can be described by the Lambda-CDM model, which uses quantum mechanics and general relativity in combination. There are currently no well-tested models describing physics prior to roughly 10⁻¹⁵ seconds. Understanding this early epoch remains one of the most significant unsolved problems in physics.
