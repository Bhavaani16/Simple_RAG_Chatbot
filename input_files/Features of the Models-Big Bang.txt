Features of the ModelsAssumptionsBig Bang cosmology depends on three major assumptions: the universality of physical laws, the cosmological principle, and the approximation that the matter content of the universe can be modeled as a perfect fluid. The universality of physical laws is a foundational idea in the theory of relativity. The cosmological principle states that on sufficiently large scales the universe is homogeneous and isotropic, meaning that it appears the same in all directions and at all locations. A perfect fluid is defined as a substance with no viscosity, in which the pressure is proportional to the density.These assumptions were initially taken as theoretical postulates, but later work sought to test each of them. Observations indicate that any change in the fine-structure constant over most of the universe’s lifetime must be extremely small. The key physical theory behind modern cosmology, general relativity, has passed stringent tests within the Solar System and in observations of binary star systems. The cosmological principle has been confirmed with high precision using measurements of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). On the scale of the CMB horizon, the universe has been measured to be extremely uniform, with only small allowed variations.Expansion PredictionThe cosmological principle simplifies the equations of general relativity, leading to the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) metric, which describes the geometry of the universe. Assuming the matter in the universe behaves like a perfect fluid, the resulting Friedmann equations determine how this geometry evolves over time. At this level of description, the mass-energy density is the key parameter: the geometry and the expansion rate of the universe follow directly from this density. The major features of Big Bang cosmology stem from these equations.Mass-Energy DensityIn Big Bang cosmology, the mass-energy density governs the shape, expansion, and fate of the universe. By combining astronomical measurements with the laws of thermodynamics and particle physics, scientists have determined the relative contributions of different components of the density throughout cosmic history. In the present-day universe, ordinary (luminous) matter—stars, planets, and gas—makes up less than 5 percent of the total density. Dark matter contributes about 27 percent, and dark energy accounts for roughly 68 percent.HorizonsA key feature of Big Bang spacetime is the presence of particle horizons. Because the universe has a finite age and light travels at a finite speed, there may be regions whose light has not yet reached Earth; this defines a past horizon. Likewise, due to the accelerating expansion of space, light emitted from Earth today may never reach certain distant regions, defining a future horizon. Whether these horizons exist depends on the specific form of the FLRW metric and the expansion behavior of the universe.Current understanding indicates that a past horizon exists, although our view is also limited by the opacity of the early universe, which prevents observation before a certain time. If cosmic expansion continues to accelerate, a future horizon also exists, placing limits on the events we can influence.ThermalizationIn the early universe, some physical processes were too slow relative to the rapid expansion to reach thermodynamic equilibrium, while others occurred quickly enough to do so. A common way to determine whether a process achieved thermal equilibrium is to compare its rate (often measured as particle collision frequency) to the Hubble parameter, which characterizes the expansion rate. If the process rate is much larger than the Hubble parameter, particles have enough time to thermalize before being carried too far apart by expansion.
